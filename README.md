Hey! I'm Alex, a.k.a. nim. I'm a hobbyist programmer in the US interested in embedded software.

I'm currently 17 years old. I'm transgender and go by she/her pronouns. I'm starting my 2nd year of a computer science associate's at my local community college.

Other hobbies of mine include Mario speedrunning and amateur linguistics. My personal site is at https://mek.sm64.us , where I list my interests, my socials/contact info, and a handful of the projects I've worked on (though I've been too lazy to finish that page lol)

The best way to contact me is at my email or over Discord at Alex__#6398 (that's two underscores!)

My other socials are listed on the site. Feel free to reach out!
